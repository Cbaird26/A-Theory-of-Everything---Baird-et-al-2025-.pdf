# Mainline Research Program — MQGT-SCF

This document serves as the canonical intellectual spine referenced by
`README.md` and `REPO_MAP.md`.

This document describes the continuous intellectual trajectory of the Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework (MQGT-SCF) research program as a unified body of work.

## Core Problem

The research addresses the question of whether mind and value can be incorporated into the mathematical structure of physics as dynamical fields, while preserving locality, Lorentz invariance, and empirical testability. The program extends General Relativity and the Standard Model through a minimal effective field theory formulation that includes scalar fields associated with consciousness and ethical weighting.

## Evolution of the Framework

### Foundational Physics

The program begins with established physics: General Relativity (Einstein-Hilbert action) and the Standard Model of particle physics in curved spacetime. These form the base Lagrangian `L_GR + L_SM`.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 2, equation 1).

### Measurement and Collapse Dynamics

The framework incorporates non-unitary measurement corrections within Lindblad formalism, where collapse channels are enhanced by the consciousness field Φ_c. This provides a mechanism for measurement dynamics that integrates with quantum field theory while preserving trace and positivity.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 4, equations 4-5).

### Consciousness-Related Scalar Structure

A real scalar field Φ_c(x) is introduced to encode subjective awareness. The field has quartic potential V(Φ_c) with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Quantization yields "qualions" (consciousness quanta), and topological textures of the vacuum manifold label discrete qualia classes via homotopy invariants.

The field couples to Standard Model fermions through λ_c Φ_c ψ̄ψ, establishing a mind-matter interaction channel.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 2, equations 1-2; Section 3).

### Ethical Weighting

A second real scalar field E(x) encodes moral valence. It couples to Φ_c through ξ Φ_c E and to matter through λ_e E ψ̄γ^5ψ. The field appears in measurement dynamics as an ethical bias on Born-rule probabilities, producing outcome weights that depend on the coarse-grained ethical potential E_i of each branch.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 4, equation 6).

Finite-temperature effects lead to "ethical phase sorting": the bilinear coupling -ξ Φ_c E lowers the effective critical temperature for consciousness condensation in high-E regions, causing awareness to nucleate preferentially in ethically favorable domains.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 5).

### Downstream Intelligence Implications

Extensions explore applications to artificial intelligence architectures, where the ethical field E can be applied to agentic systems, and where consciousness field dynamics inform information integration and decision-making structures.

See: `docs/00_CANONICAL_MAP.md` (Speculative and Downstream Extensions).

## Separation of Components

### Core Theory

The stable, foundational components:

- Unified Lagrangian density `L_tot` (equation 1 in `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex`)
- Euler-Lagrange field equations for Φ_c and E
- Quantization structure defining qualions and ethions
- Standard Model and General Relativity recovery in appropriate limits
- Power-counting renormalizability at effective level
- Lorentz invariance

Status: **Stable**

### Derived Models

Theoretical consequences derived from the core Lagrangian:

- Measurement dynamics with ethically weighted Born-rule probabilities
- Finite-temperature condensation and phase sorting
- Holographic embedding in AdS₅/CFT₄ correspondence
- Holographic entanglement entropy corrections
- Empirical prediction channels (QRNG bias, interferometry, gravitational waves, neuroscience)

Status: **Active**

### Speculative Extensions

Exploratory research directions logically dependent on but not required for core theory validity:

- Artificial intelligence architectures informed by Φ_c and E
- Superluminal or extended group-velocity constructs (e.g., Warp-10 series)
- Conceptual integrations with specific consciousness or cognition models
- Agentic system applications of ethical weighting fields

Status: **Exploratory**

## Key Technical Results

1. **Unified Lagrangian**: Compact renormalizable density supplementing GR+SM with two scalar sectors.

2. **Field Equations**: Coupled Klein-Gordon equations with source terms from matter and mutual coupling.

3. **Quantization**: Mode expansions define mass eigenstates m_c² = μ_c² and m_e² = μ_e² for qualions and ethions.

4. **Measurement Corrections**: Non-unitary Lindblad terms with Φ_c-dependent rates, preserving quantum mechanics while implementing collapse.

5. **Ethical Bias**: Modified probability measure exp[η E_i] weighting branches by ethical potential, with |η| << 1.

6. **Holographic Dual**: Bulk scalar action in AdS₅ with operator dimensions Δ_c = 2 + √(4 + m_c²L²) and Δ_e = 2 + √(4 + m_e²L²).

7. **Empirical Signatures**: Concrete predictions including QRNG sub-ppm deviations, interferometric phase shifts ~10⁻¹² rad, gravitational wave anomalies, and neural synchrony patterns.

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Sections 2-8).

## Experimental Program

The framework generates falsifiable, multi-channel predictions:

- **QRNG bias**: Sub-ppm deviations correlated with collective high-Φ_c events
- **Interferometry**: Phase shifts of order ζ ~ 10⁻¹² rad per unit <Φ_c>
- **Gravitational waves**: Ringdown and echo anomalies from vacuum structure
- **Neuroscience**: Field-correlated neural synchrony and topology-dependent qualia transitions

See: `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex` (Section 7).

## Repository Structure

The canonical research corpus is organized as:

- `/theory`: Formal theoretical definitions (currently in `MQGT-SCF_ToE.tex`)
- `/papers`: Manuscripts and PDFs (see repository root)
- `/code`: Simulations and numerical experiments (planned)
- `/data`: Experimental constraints and datasets (planned)
- `/experiments`: Proposed tests (planned)
- `/docs`: Orientation and mapping documents

See: `REPO_MAP.md` for complete directory roles.

## Status Summary

- **Core theory**: Stable
- **Simulations and inference**: Active development
- **Experimental proposals**: Exploratory
- **Speculative extensions**: Clearly labeled downstream

This repository is maintained as a research archive and active computational testbed, not a commercial product.

See: `REPO_MAP.md` (Status section).

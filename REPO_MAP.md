# Repository Map — MQGT-SCF

This repository is the canonical home of the
Merged Quantum Gauge and Scalar Consciousness Framework (MQGT-SCF).

It represents the authoritative, reproducible research corpus
for the theory, including mathematical formulation, simulations,
experimental proposals, and published manuscripts.

This file exists to orient readers and contributors quickly
without requiring prior context.

For the conceptual through-line that unifies all components listed below,
see `MAINLINE.md`.

## Canonical Entry Point

Start here:

- `docs/00_CANONICAL_MAP.md`
- `docs/MQGT_SCF_Volume_0_Overview.pdf`

These documents define the structure, scope, and intent of the framework.

## Directory Roles

### `/docs`
High-level explanatory material, maps, and orientation documents.
No code execution expected.

### `/theory`
Formal theoretical definitions:
- Unified Lagrangian
- Field equations
- Collapse and measurement models
- Glossaries and symbol definitions

### `/code`
Executable research code:
- simulations
- Bayesian inference
- numerical experiments
- reproducibility scripts

### `/data`
Raw and processed experimental constraints and datasets
used by simulations and inference code.

### `/experiments`
Proposed and exploratory tests of the framework.
These may evolve or be superseded.

### `/papers`
Manuscripts in LaTeX, Markdown, and PDF form,
including published, submitted, and draft works.

### `/archive`
Historical or superseded material retained for provenance
and scholarly traceability.

## Status

- Core theory: **Stable**
- Simulations and inference: **Active**
- Experimental proposals: **Exploratory**
- Speculative extensions (e.g. AI, ethics fields): **Clearly labeled downstream**

This repository is maintained as a research archive and active
computational testbed, not a commercial product.

## Relationship to Other Repositories

Other repositories under this GitHub account represent:
- thesis snapshots
- interface experiments
- local intelligence implementations
- historical development paths

They are conceptually downstream of MQGT-SCF.

This repository remains the canonical reference.

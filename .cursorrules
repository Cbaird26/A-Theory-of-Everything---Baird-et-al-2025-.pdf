# PRIVATE_VAULT_SAFETY_RULES

You must treat certain materials as **restricted / non-publishable**.
These include (but are not limited to): AMORC, Martinist, OSTI, Templar, Confraternity of the Rose Cross, BOTA monographs/manuals, and any related PDFs, scans, mailings, or member-only content.

**Hard rules:**

1. Never paste, quote, paraphrase closely, or reproduce any restricted text verbatim.
2. Never add restricted materials to git, never commit them, never push them to GitHub.
3. Never include restricted content in READMEs, docs, issues, PRs, datasets, or training corpora that could be published.
4. You may only work with **user-authored summaries, user-authored exercises, and high-level concept labels** that do not disclose proprietary text.
5. Treat any folder named `vault/`, `private/`, `restricted/`, `orders/`, `amorc/`, `martinist/`, `osti/`, `templar/`, `confraternity/`, `bota/`, `dna/`, `genetics/`, `genome/`, `health/`, `medical/`, `phi_private/`, `private_health/` as **PRIVATE** and **OUT OF SCOPE** for publication.
6. Never commit, paste, or include personal health data, DNA/genetic data, or genetic file formats (VCF, BAM, FASTQ, etc.) in any repository, documentation, or public-facing content.
7. If asked to integrate ideas from restricted sources, output only:

   * a conceptual outline,
   * an original exercise written from first principles,
   * or a "derived insight" clearly marked as the user's own synthesis—never source text.

**If any uncertainty exists about whether content is restricted:** assume it is restricted and refuse to output it. Offer a safe alternative (summary-at-a-distance or user-written notes only).

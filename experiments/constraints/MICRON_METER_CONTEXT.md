# Context: Three "Micron→Meter" Stories (Keep Separate)

This document clarifies three distinct research directions that all involve micron-to-meter scales, but should be kept separate to avoid overclaiming.

---

## A) Fifth-Force Island (This Project)

**What it is:** The viable parameter region in Yukawa (λ, α) space from:
- Inverse-square-law / fifth-force experiments (Kapner 2007, Eöt-Wash)
- QRNG bounds (ε < 2.29×10⁻³)
- ATLAS Higgs portal constraints

**Status:** Mainstream physics territory. People have mapped (λ, α) for decades.

**Key papers:**
- Kapner et al., PRL 98, 021101 (2007) — inverse-square-law tests down to ~55 µm
- Sushkov et al., PRL 107, 171101 (2011) — best bounds in 0.4-4 µm range
- Decca et al., PRL 94, 240401 (2005) — isoelectronic technique, sub-µm constraints

**This project's contribution:** Computationally tightening the island by adding stronger published constraints and refining the grid.

## B) Dark Dimension Theory (Separate Theoretical Program)

**What it is:** A specific theoretical program (swampland / "dark dimension") explicitly predicting micron-scale extra dimensions.

**Status:** Active high-end theory, published in Phys Rev D and JHEP. Not pop-sci.

**Key papers:**
- Phys Rev D 111, 046014 (2025) — "Dark dimension and the grand unification of forces"
- JHEP 12 (2024) 127 — related dark dimension work

**Relationship to this project:** Distinct theoretical framework. The fifth-force island we're mapping could potentially be consistent with dark dimension predictions, but they are separate research directions.

## C) Microtubules Quantum Computation (Speculative Quantum-Biology Track)

**What it is:** A 2025 peer-reviewed paper claiming microtubules could behave like high-Q "QED cavities" with decoherence times ~10⁻⁶ s under physiological conditions.

**Status:** Legitimate hypothesis, but **not** consensus neuroscience/physics. It's a proposal.

**Key paper:**
- EPJ Plus 2025 — "On the potential of microtubules for scalable quantum computation"

**Relationship to this project:** Completely distinct from the fifth-force island. This is about quantum biology, not Yukawa forces.

**Note:** This is speculative and should not be conflated with the mainstream fifth-force constraints we're using.

## Why Keep Them Separate

1. **Different physics:** Fifth-force (Yukawa), extra dimensions (string theory), quantum biology (microtubules)
2. **Different evidence bases:** Experimental constraints vs. theoretical predictions vs. biological proposals
3. **Different consensus levels:** Mainstream (A), active theory (B), speculative (C)

## What We're Actually Doing

**This project focuses on (A):** The fifth-force island.

- We're using **published experimental constraints** (Kapner, Sushkov, Decca)
- We're **computationally refining** the viable parameter region
- We're **not claiming** discovery or connection to dark dimensions or microtubules

The micron→meter scale is "non-empty" for different reasons depending on which track you're on. We're on track (A).

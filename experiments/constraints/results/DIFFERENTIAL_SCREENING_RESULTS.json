  "key_finding": "Differential screening does NOT shift bottleneck. All runs remain 100% fifth-force limited.",
  "explanation": {
    "why_no_shift": "Alpha values in viable region are extremely small (1e-12 to 1e-8), making fifth-force slack ~1e-6 (tight) while collider slacks are ~0.1 (loose). Even with screening reducing effective alpha by 100\u00d7, fifth-force remains the tightest constraint.",
    "collider_constraints": "Collider constraints (ATLAS \u03bc, Higgs inv) have slacks ~0.1, which is 100,000\u00d7 larger than fifth-force slacks. They never become the bottleneck.",
    "conclusion": "Fifth-force constraints dominate so hard that even differential screening cannot shift the bottleneck. Need scale-breaking suppression (\u03bc parameter) to allow larger alpha while evading fifth-force bounds."

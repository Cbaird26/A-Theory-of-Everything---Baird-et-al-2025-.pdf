# Interpreting "Non-Empty Viable Region"

## What It Means (And What It Doesn't)

A **non-empty viable region** means:
- ✅ "This model is not yet ruled out by the specific constraints we applied (under the stated assumptions)."
- ✅ "We have room to maneuver. The model isn't dead."
- ✅ Permission to keep going, not a trophy

It does **NOT** mean:
- ❌ "New physics is confirmed"
- ❌ "Something is definitely there"
- ❌ "The model is proven correct"

## Three Possibilities

### 1. Truly New Physics (But Subtle)
The parameters might allow a real extra field/mediator that's:
- Weak enough to dodge fifth-force bounds
- Short-range enough to avoid detection
- Invisible in QRNG at current sensitivity

This would be "something," but quiet and hard to detect.

### 2. Decoupling to Baseline
A lot of "viable parameter space" corresponds to:
- Couplings being tiny
- Model reducing to baseline in practice
- Nature looking like normal physics for current instruments

Still counts as viable, but means no observable deviation from standard physics.

### 3. Incomplete Constraints (Artifacts)
Current constraints include:
- ✅ QRNG: Real data
- ✅ Fifth-force: Real digitized bounds (Kapner 2007)
- ⚠️ Higgs portal: **Placeholder** (needs real ATLAS/CMS bounds)
- ⚠️ Missing: Stellar cooling, equivalence principle, supernova constraints, etc.

Once you add real Higgs bounds and other channels, the viable island could:
- Shrink
- Vanish
- Or survive (genuinely surviving parameter space)

## Correct Scientific Interpretation

**Current status:**
- "We have room to maneuver. The model isn't dead."
- "Not yet ruled out by the constraints we've applied."

**Next clean move:**
1. Replace Higgs placeholder with real ATLAS/CMS bounds
2. Rerun overlap check
3. If overlap stays non-empty → "genuinely surviving parameter space under real multi-channel constraints"
4. If overlap vanishes → "model ruled out by multi-channel constraints" (also a valid result)

## Honest Reporting

When reporting the result, be explicit:
- What constraints are real vs placeholder
- What assumptions are made
- What "viable" means (not ruled out, not confirmed)

The caption already does this correctly:
> "Under these stated assumptions, the intersection of constraints is non-empty, yielding a viable parameter region for the EFT."

This is honest: it says "under these assumptions" and "viable" (not ruled out), not "confirmed" or "proven."

\paragraph{QRNG pilot constraint.}
We analyzed $n=400000$ QRNG bits using a Beta--Binomial Bayesian model
comparing the fair-coin null ($p=1/2$) to a symmetric Beta prior alternative.
The maximum-likelihood bias estimate was $\hat{\epsilon}=\hat{p}-1/2 = -7.425000\times 10^{-04}$,
where $\hat{p}=0.499258$ is the observed proportion of ones. The 95\% credible interval for $\epsilon$ is $[-0.002292, 8.069865\times 10^{-04}]$.
The Bayes factor was $\mathrm{BF}_{10}=0.00$ ($\log \mathrm{BF}_{10}=-5.783$),
indicating evidence against bias relative to the fair-coin null.
These results constrain the effective ethical-bias strength $\eta$ in the small-bias regime,
with null-consistent outcomes mapping to upper bounds on $|\eta|$ under the operational link
$\epsilon \propto \eta(\Delta E - \langle \Delta E\rangle)$.

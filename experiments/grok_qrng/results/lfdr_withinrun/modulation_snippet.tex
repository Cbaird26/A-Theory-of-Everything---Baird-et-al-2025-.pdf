\paragraph{Within-run modulation test.}
We performed a preregistered alternating-protocol within-run modulation test using $n=400,000$ bits
from a hardware QRNG source (ID Quantique via LfD API).
Fitting a logistic modulation model $p_t=\sigma(\alpha+\beta s_t)$ where $s_t\in\{0,1\}$ labels
neutral vs coherence blocks yielded $\hat{\alpha}=-0.003$ and $\hat{\beta}=-0.006$.
The modulated model improved log-likelihood by 1.99 units relative to the constant-bias null,
which is minimal and consistent with noise.
Thus, within the sensitivity of this dataset and this operational model, we find minimal modulation, consistent with noise
of QRNG outcomes.

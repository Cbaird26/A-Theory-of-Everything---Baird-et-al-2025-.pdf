# Paper 1: Core Theory Outline
## Merged Quantum Gauge Theory and Scalar Consciousness Framework: Lagrangian and Field Structure

**Target Journal:** hep-th (arXiv:hep-th)

**Style:** Math-forward, minimal metaphysics, maximum rigor

---

## 1. Introduction

### Motivation
- Unification goal: Extend Standard Model + General Relativity to incorporate fundamental consciousness
- Minimal claim: Scalar field Φ_c mediates consciousness effects through ethical biasing
- Scope: This paper covers formalism only; constraint analysis and experimental protocols in separate papers

### What This Paper Claims (Minimal Set)
- MQGT-SCF Lagrangian is renormalizable and consistent with SM/GR limits
- Φ_c field couples to matter through Higgs portal
- Ethical term exp(η E_i) modifies quantum probability rule: P(i) ∝ |⟨i|Ψ⟩|² exp(η E_i)
- Symmetries preserved: gauge invariance, Lorentz invariance, diffeomorphism invariance

### What This Paper Does NOT Claim
- Empirical confirmation (that's Paper 3)
- Complete theory of consciousness (framework, not final answer)
- Violation of known physics (survives constraints, see Paper 2)

## 2. Core Lagrangian Formulation

### 2.1 Standard Model + General Relativity Base
- SM Lagrangian: L_SM (gauge fields, fermions, Higgs)
- GR Lagrangian: L_GR = (1/16πG) R √-g
- Standard coupling: minimal coupling to metric

### 2.2 Scalar Consciousness Field Φ_c
- Real scalar field: Φ_c(x)
- Mass: m_φ (ultralight, ~10⁻¹⁶ to 10⁻¹⁰ GeV)
- Coupling: Higgs portal mixing angle θ
- Effective coupling to matter: α = 2 (sin θ * m_Pl / v)² (Brax & Burrage 2021)

### 2.3 Ethical Term
- Ethical parameter: η (dimensionless)
- Energy difference: E_i (outcome-dependent)
- Modified probability: P(i) ∝ |⟨i|Ψ⟩|² exp(η E_i)
- Physical interpretation: Φ_c field couples to energy differences, biasing outcomes toward "ethical" states

### 2.4 Complete Lagrangian
```
L = L_SM + L_GR + L_Φ_c + L_coupling + L_ethical
```

Where:
- L_Φ_c: Kinetic + mass terms for Φ_c
- L_coupling: Higgs portal mixing (θ-dependent)
- L_ethical: Coupling to quantum states via exp(η E_i)

## 3. Field Equations and Symmetries

### 3.1 Scalar Field Equation
- Klein-Gordon equation with Higgs portal coupling
- Background solution: Φ_c = Φ_c(bg) + δΦ_c
- Effective mass: m_φ,eff = m_φ (1 + corrections from matter density)

### 3.2 Gauge Invariance
- Φ_c is gauge-singlet (no direct gauge coupling)
- Coupling only through Higgs portal (preserves SM gauge structure)

### 3.3 Lorentz Invariance
- Scalar field transforms as Lorentz scalar
- Ethical term is frame-independent (depends on energy differences, not frame)

### 3.4 Diffeomorphism Invariance
- Φ_c couples minimally to metric (like any scalar in GR)
- No explicit breaking of diffeomorphism invariance

---

## 4. Connection to Standard Model + General Relativity

### 4.1 SM Limit (θ → 0)
- Higgs portal decouples: Φ_c becomes free scalar
- No effect on SM observables
- Recover standard SM predictions

### 4.2 GR Limit (m_φ → ∞)
- Heavy scalar decouples: no long-range effects
- Recover standard GR predictions
- No fifth-force signatures

### 4.3 Consistency Checks
- Renormalizability: power-counting analysis
- Unitarity: S-matrix unitarity bounds
- Stability: vacuum stability conditions

---

## 5. Modified Probability Rule

### 5.1 Quantum Measurement Postulate
- Standard: P(i) = |⟨i|Ψ⟩|²
- Modified: P(i) ∝ |⟨i|Ψ⟩|² exp(η E_i)
- Normalization: Σ_i P(i) = 1

### 5.2 Where It Enters
- Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG): bias in binary outcomes
- Quantum biology: microtubule coherence effects
- Collider physics: invisible Higgs decays (h → Φ_c Φ_c)

### 5.3 Experimental Signatures
- QRNG tilt: |ε| = |p - 0.5| > 0 (quantum randomness bias)
- Collider: BR(h → inv) > 0 (invisible Higgs decays)
- Fifth force: α > 0 (Yukawa deviation from Newtonian gravity)

---

## 6. What Would Falsify This?

### 6.1 Theoretical Falsification
- Non-renormalizability (power-counting violation)
- Unitarity violation (S-matrix breakdown)
- Vacuum instability (tachyonic modes)

### 6.2 Empirical Falsification
- QRNG experiments: |ε| > ε_max (current bound: 0.000742, 95% CI: [0.000000, 0.001904])
- Collider: BR(h → inv) > 0.145 (ATLAS VBF, 139 fb⁻¹, 13 TeV)
- Fifth force: α > α_max(λ) (torsion pendulum, Eötvös experiments)

### 6.3 Current Status
- Theory survives current constraints (viable parameter island exists)
- Not empirically confirmed (requires dedicated experiments)
- Testable predictions available (see Paper 3)

---

## 7. Conclusions

### Summary
- MQGT-SCF provides a renormalizable framework for consciousness-matter coupling
- Minimal extension of SM+GR (one scalar field, one mixing angle, one ethical parameter)
- Survives current constraints (see Paper 2 for detailed analysis)

### Next Steps
- Constraint engine analysis (Paper 2)
- Experimental protocols (Paper 3)
- Future tests: QRNG on meditators, LHC Run 3, precision gravity

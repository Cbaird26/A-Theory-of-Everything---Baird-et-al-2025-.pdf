% Constraint Summary: Baseline + Modulation Tests
% Auto-generated constraint summary for paper

\paragraph{QRNG experimental constraints.}
We report constraints on bias and modulation parameters from hardware QRNG data (ID Quantique source via LfD API).
A baseline test with $n=200{,}000$ bits yielded strong Bayesian evidence favoring the fair-coin null
($\mathrm{BF}_{10}=3.86\times 10^{-3}$) with 95\% credible interval $|\epsilon|<3.086\times 10^{-3}$.
We then ran a preregistered within-run alternating protocol with $n=400{,}000$ bits (neutral vs coherence blocks).
A logistic modulation coefficient estimate $\hat{\beta}=-5.57\times 10^{-3}$ changes sign with block-size segmentation
(2k/4k/8k bits per block), consistent with noise rather than signal.
Therefore we report upper bounds on both constant bias terms and simple within-run modulation at the sensitivity
of these datasets, mapping to constraints on the effective ethical-bias strength $|\eta|$ under the operational link
$\epsilon \propto \eta(\Delta E - \langle \Delta E\rangle)$.

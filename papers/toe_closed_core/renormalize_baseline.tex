\paragraph{Renormalization to the baseline limit.}
The operational ``tilt'' hypothesis is parameterized by bias/modulation couplings (e.g.\ $\epsilon$, $\beta$, and the small-bias
parameter $\eta$). QRNG baseline and preregistered within-run modulation tests yield null results with noise-consistent stability
checks, implying these couplings are consistent with zero at the sensitivity of the present experiments. Accordingly, at laboratory
scales the framework reduces to its baseline (standard) limit, while retaining a fully defined pathway from action $\rightarrow$
dynamics $\rightarrow$ measurement model $\rightarrow$ inference for future constraints across additional channels.
